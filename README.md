The **persist-text-scale** is an Emacs package that persists and restores the text scale for files and special buffers. By default, it saves the text scale individually for each file and applies a shared text scale for categories of special buffers. This behavior ensures a consistent and personalized reading experience across sessions.

You can customize how buffer categories are determined by setting using a function. This function should return a category identifier based on the buffer context. Buffers within the same category will share the same text scale.

## Features

- Automatically persists the text scale for every file buffer.
- Applies a shared text scale for categories of special buffers.
- Fully customizable categorization logic for text scale grouping.
- Lightweight and efficient with minimal configuration.
