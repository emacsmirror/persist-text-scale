The **persist-text-scale** Emacs package provides `persist-text-scale-mode`, which ensures that all adjustments made with `text-scale-increase` and `text-scale-decrease` are persisted and restored across sessions. As a result, the text size in each buffer remains consistent, even after restarting Emacs.

This package also facilitates grouping buffers into categories, allowing buffers within the same category to share a consistent text scale. This ensures uniform font sizes when adjusting text scaling. By default:
- Each file-visiting buffer has its own independent text scale.
- Special buffers, identified by their buffer names, each retain their own text scale setting.
- All Dired buffers maintain the same font size, treating Dired as a unified "file explorer" where the text scale remains consistent across different buffers.

This category-based behavior can be further customized by assigning a function to the `persist-text-scale-buffer-category-function` variable. The function determines how buffers are categorized by returning a category identifier (string) based on the buffer's context. Buffers within the same category will share the same text scale.

## Features

- Lightweight and efficient, requiring minimal configuration.
- Automatically saves and restores the text scale for all buffer types, including file, indirect, dired, and special buffers.
- Periodically saves text scale data at intervals defined by `persist-text-scale-autosave-interval`, which can be set to `nil` to disable or specified in seconds to enable.
- Provides unified text scaling across buffer categories, with fully customizable logic for categorizing buffers based on text scale. Users can customize categorization by specifying a function for the `persist-text-scale-buffer-category-function` variable, ensuring that groups of buffers maintain consistent text scale persistence and restoration.
- The user can define the maximum number of retained entries using `persist-text-scale-history-length`.

## Installation

### Emacs: Install with straight (Emacs version < 30)

To install *persist-text-scale* with `straight.el`:

1. It if hasn't already been done, [add the straight.el bootstrap code](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to your init file.
2. Add the following code to the Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package persist-text-scale
  :ensure t
  :straight (persist-text-scale
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "jamescherti/persist-text-scale.el")
  :custom
  ;; Time interval, in seconds, between automatic saves of text scale data.
  ;; If set to an integer value, enables periodic autosaving of persisted text
  ;; scale information at the specified interval.
  ;; If set to nil, disables timer-based autosaving entirely.
  (persist-text-scale-autosave-interval (* 7 60))
  :config
  (persist-text-scale-mode))
```

### Emacs: Installing with use-package and :vc (Built-in feature in Emacs version >= 30)

To install *persist-text-scale* with `use-package` and `:vc` (Emacs >= 30):

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package persist-text-scale
  :ensure t
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/jamescherti/persist-text-scale.el"
       :rev :newest)
  :custom
  ;; Time interval, in seconds, between automatic saves of text scale data.
  ;; If set to an integer value, enables periodic autosaving of persisted text
  ;; scale information at the specified interval.
  ;; If set to nil, disables timer-based autosaving entirely.
  (persist-text-scale-autosave-interval (* 7 60))
  :config
  (persist-text-scale-mode))
```

## Doom Emacs

Here is how to install *persist-text-scale* on Doom Emacs:

1. Add to the `~/.doom.d/packages.el` file:
```elisp
(package! persist-text-scale
 :recipe
 (:host github :repo "jamescherti/persist-text-scale.el"))
```

2. Add to `~/.doom.d/config.el`:
```elisp
;; TODO: Load the mode here
(after! persist-text-scale
  ;; Time interval, in seconds, between automatic saves of text scale data.
  ;; If set to an integer value, enables periodic autosaving of persisted text
  ;; scale information at the specified interval.
  ;; If set to nil, disables timer-based autosaving entirely.
  (setq persist-text-scale-autosave-interval (* 7 60))

  (persist-text-scale-mode))
```

3. Run the `doom sync` command:
```
doom sync
```
